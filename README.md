# 🐱 Doraemon Drawing with Python Turtle

This project draws the iconic cartoon character **Doraemon** using Python’s built-in `turtle` graphics module.

> ✏️ A fun beginner-friendly project to explore drawing and turtle graphics in Python!

---

## 📷 Preview

When you run the script, a colorful image of Doraemon will be drawn in a new window step-by-step.

## 🚀 Features

- Full-body **Doraemon character drawing**
- Uses **mathematical curves and shapes**
- Utilizes Python’s built-in **`turtle` module**
- Draws features like: head, eyes, mouth, scarf, nose, feet, and body
- Adds signature text at the end

---

## 🛠 Requirements

- Python 3.x
- No external libraries — just `turtle` (built-in in Python)

---

## 📦 How to Run

1. Make sure you have Python 3 installed.
2. Save the file as `Dorempon.py`
3. Run the script:

```bash
python Dorempon.py
```

A window will open and **Doraemon** will be drawn step-by-step.

## 🧠 How It Works

- The drawing is done using custom Python functions like `eyes()`, `beard()`, `mouth()`, etc.
- The main function `Doraemon()` controls the full composition
- Turtle commands like `circle()`, `goto()`, `seth()`, `fillcolor()` are used for each part

## 📬 Suggestions

- Try changing colors or shapes to draw your own characters!
- You can speed up or slow down the drawing by editing the `speed()` function.
